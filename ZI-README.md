- Added AuthGuard to protect routes from unauthenticated JWTs
- Added a 'Books' module to handle all book-related routes
- Got the backend working with all validation and error handling
- Added postman collection and environment files for testing
- Started Implementation of Pagination and Sorting features but ran out of time when trying to test, so I removed them from my postman tests
- Started working on the frontend, but ran into CORS issues with Angular and NestJS.  I tried to fix it, but I ran out of time.
- I have a lot of experience with NestJS, but I have never used Angular before. I have used React, so I am familiar with the concepts, but I have never used Angular before. I spent a lot of time trying to get the frontend working, but I ran out of time. I am confident that I could get it working if I had more time.
